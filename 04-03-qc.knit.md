# QC Filtering {#qc}


<!-- Discuss counts per cell/gene and make plots -->
<!-- Discuss that there's no one threshold -->
<!-- everyone pick a threshold and go filter -->
<!-- check numbers of cells. -->
<!-- save your object -->
<!-- (other qc metrics = Mt gene content, cell cycle asignment, low seq diversity e.t.c) -->




The steps below encompass the standard pre-processing workflow for scRNA-seq data in Seurat. These represent the selection and filtration of cells based on QC metrics, data normalization and scaling, and the detection of highly variable features.

## QC and selecting cells for further analysis

Seurat allows you to easily explore QC metrics and filter cells based on any user-defined criteria. A few QC metrics [commonly used](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4758103/) by the community include

* The number of unique genes detected in each cell. 
    + Low-quality cells or empty droplets will often have very few genes
    + Cell doublets or multiplets may exhibit an aberrantly high gene count
* Similarly, the total number of molecules detected within a cell (correlates strongly with unique genes)
* The percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome
    + Low-quality / dying cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination
    + We calculate mitochondrial QC metrics with the `PercentageFeatureSet()` function, which calculates the percentage of counts originating from a set of features
    + We use the set of all genes starting with `MT-` as a set of mitochondrial genes
