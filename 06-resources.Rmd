## Help and fruther Resources

### Seurat Vignettes {-}

https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html
 
There are a good many Seurat vigettes for different aspects of the Seurat package. E.g. 

*[Guided Clustering tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) : We've just worked through this
*[Differential expression](https://satijalab.org/seurat/archive/v3.1/de_vignette.html 
*[Data integration](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction.html)


### Seurat Cheatsheet {-}

https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/essential_commands.html

A useful resource for asking; How can I do 'X' with my seurat object?


### OSCA {-}

https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/

An comprehensive resource for analysis approaches for single cell data. 
This uses the SingleCellExperiment bioconductor ecosystem, but alot of the same principle still apply.


### MBP training Reading list {-}

https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/Single-Cell-Workshop/

A workshop page run by Monash Bioinformatics Platform (source of today's workshop) - down the bottom there
is an extensive list of useful single cell links and resources.


### Biocommons Single Cell Omics {-}

https://www.biocommons.org.au/single-cell-omics

Join the single cell omics community resources being setup by biocommons. 


## Data

### Demo 10X data {-}

https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets

10X genomics have quite a few example datasets availble for download (including PBMC3k). 
This is a useful resource if you want to see what the 'raw' data looks like for a particular technology.


## Tools


### Cell Ranger

https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger

CellRanger is the 10X tool that takes raw fastq sequence files and produces the counts matricies that are the starting point for today's analysis.


### STARSolo

STAR is an aligner (used within cellRanger). STARSolo is a method for
